  My name is Tal Nesher. I am 25 years old. I was born in Kfar Saba, Israel, on the 17th of July (which also happens to be the date of the calendar emoji!). A few years ago, my family moved to Hod Hasharon, where they currently reside.
  My father is an engineer in the field of geodesy (the creation of maps), and my mother is an architect. Today, my parents are divorced, but they live close by. Fortunately, they maintain a very good connection. We all meet once in a while, celebrate together, and hang out, so it still feels like we are one big family.
  I have one younger sister, Adva, who is starting her bachelor's degree in electrical engineering at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. Coincidentally, that's where I study!
  I have just completed my second year at BGU, pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in data science. So far, the studies have been challenging but also quite interesting, shedding new light on how technology works—a topic I am genuinely passionate about. And, of course, I met many new and wonderful friends with whom I learn and have a lot of fun in the evenings.
  I am engaged to my high school sweetheart and amazing fiancé, Nir Shafir, who is a third-year student in psychology and wants to be a developmental psychologist to help special needs children. She is also an amazing cooker! We leave in an apartment in Beer Sheva which we bought and renovated togeather. We have our very cute and somewhat fat cat named "Kitten." Yes, I know it's a funny name for a cat, but Nir couldn't decide on a name, and the poor cat just stuck with Kitten.

  I spent all of my school years at the Democratic School of Kfar Saba. It's a special school where students can decide what to learn and what not to. The whole approach to students, from both the school and teachers, is very different from other "regular" schools. I feel like my school experience contributed a lot to my personality and taught me responsibility, time management, curiosity, social skills, and much more.
  As a child, I loved playing with Lego. I always tried to create aesthetically pleasing yet practical models. I guess I've always had a passion for problem-solving and doing things precisely. I could sit for hours until I was satisfied with the result.
  I also practiced fencing for many years, going to the fencing club five times a week. To this day, sports are a significant part of my life, and I regularly go to the gym, run, and practice at home.
  I was also very active in the youth movement Hasomer Hazair and led a group for three years. It was one of the most meaningful things I had ever done.

  After I graduated, I enrolled to 669 unit, which proved to be a few demanding, yet immensely empowering and formative months. After about half a year, I was transferred to the IDF's Counter Terror Unit to complete my training. During this phase, I served as an operator, commander, and senior instructor. This meant that I led a team of operator-instructors, and together, we were responsible for designing and executing multi-week training sessions. These sessions provided instruction in underground warfare techniques, which we had developed, to IDF special and elite units, as well as units from around the world.
  As the senior instructor, I needed to maintain the highest level of professionalism in our field and effectively communicate this knowledge to fellow operators. I also played a pivotal role in training other instructors and helping them develop their skills. For my dedication and outstanding performance, I received awards for excellence in my duties, and I firmly believe that I made a substantial contribution to my unit.
  Today, I continue to volunteer regularly to assist as a reservist, contributing to the ongoing success of our unit.

  After I was discharged, I decided to pursue my passion in the world of bartending and cocktails. I enrolled in a bartending course and built my own home bar cart, equipped with everything needed to craft excellent cocktails. I also started working as a bartender at a reputable restaurant near my house. After about a year, during which I consistently demonstrated excellent work practices and professional knowledge in the bar, I asked to be appointed as a bar manager and was offered the position.
  I worked as a bar manager there for a few months until I received an offer from another cocktail bar to manage their establishment, an offer I accepted. I managed the bar, called "Funky Sicilia," for almost a year until I started my current learning endeavor.
  As a bar manager, I was responsible for overseeing the staff, designing the bar program, creating the menu, setting pricing, managing inventory, and, of course, ensuring the satisfaction and well-being of our customers. I had a wonderful time there, learned a great deal, and had the opportunity to enjoy many amazing cocktails.
  To this day, bartending remains one of my biggest hobbies, and I continue to create creative, advanced, and delicious cocktails at home. I am also currently working as a bartender at a neighborhood student bar in Beer Sheva.
